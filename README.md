# GoogleSearchCleaner
A google search extension intended to clean out unwanted personalization and tracking data.

Please note: 
This extension does NOT focus on privacy, it will NOT remove many features google has in place to track and store your data, its intended use is rather to allow users to search on google without any personalization, for more consistent results, and to prevent websites from tracking many origin identifiers.
